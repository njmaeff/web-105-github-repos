## Git Commands

- `git init`

This command initializes an empty repository you may use for version control using git. 

- `git add`

This command stages a file to be commited. It must be run in order to include files in the next commit revision. You can run `git add --all`to stage all files in the current working directory.

- `git commit`

This command will commit all staged files added with the `git add` command. Once a commit is performed, we have a new revision we may revert or compare back to later. We can explore previous revisions using the `git log` command.
